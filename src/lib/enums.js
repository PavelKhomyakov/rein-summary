    RION: "A prince hailing from a kingdom on the precipice of war, Rion is ostracized by his father due to his sickly demeanor and advocation for peace. After being locked in the castle's storeroom, he meets a defective clockwork soldier, Dimos, with whom he quickly forms a close bond. The two make their way to the throne room to demand a stop to the war, only for the king to label Rion a traitor and order him killed. After a narrow escape, Rion and Dimos decide to travel the kingdom together to find a way to put a stop to the war for the sake of his people. Some time later, the pair find themselves on the outskirts of a windswept town. Looking for a place to rest, they make their way through, only to be stopped by men who recognize the boy as royalty. After a quick altercation, the two decide it best to leave the town behind, continuing their journey. Eventually, they find themselves sheltering in a dilapidated church. Rion rests in the back of the chapel, weak from both his disease and hunger, while Dimos searches for food. He is able to find a few apples, but after being offered them, Rion's body is too weak and frail to accept them. Rion soon after succumbs to his illness, Dimos continuing to protect the prince's body even in death. Over a century later, a bounty hunter, Gayle, makes her way to the church on rumors of a clockwork soldier killing anyone who comes near. When she arrives, a rusted—but still functional—Dimos protecting Rion's corpse remains. The two fight, only for the soldier to be finally struck down. Gayle checks his logs and learns of the pair's past, deciding to build a grave to mourn them before moving on.",

    ARGO: "An adventurer who lives only for the rush of going on perilous journeys, Argo spends his days climbing the tallest of mountains and exploring the harshest of environments. His journeying leads him to another such peak, one where no man is said to have ever reached the summit—and while the mountain itself seems to deny him passage, he pushes on. A blizzard soon sets in over the mountain, and Argo is forced to seek shelter in a cave. He recalls a letter and charm in his pocket, given to him by his daughter, which gives him a renewed strength to continue. Halfway up the mountain, he encounters a lake with a corpse along the shore. He finds a note, and in shaky handwriting it relays the corpse's regrets about leaving his family behind to attempt the climb. Argo reaches the final cliff before the peak, and after a perilous ascent he reaches the top. Despite the rumors of no one reaching the summit, he finds a ruined shrine waiting for him. He steps inside, and to his surprise he sees his wife—who questions him about why he would leave his family with a baby on the way. The man rubs his eyes, seeing then the corpse of a pregnant woman holding a familiar charm, and decides to quickly return home to his family. In a snowy forest, a pregnant woman and her daughter await the return of her husband in the comfort of their home. They talk of what they'll do when he gets back, when suddenly the woman clutches her stomach in pain—her baby is ready to be born. Argo awakens below the final cliff before the peak, realizing that he never made it to the top—the shrine was only a final dream he imagined as he fell. He feels for his daughter's charm in his pocket, and with its warmth he closes his eyes.",

    PRISONER: "An imprisoned soldier from a future where monstrous Flowers threaten human extinction, 063y and his wife, F66x, are forced by the government to fight in the military. Long ago they lived a mundane family life with their son, but it was quickly taken away with the child's death when the Flowers attacked. The prisoner's lives are meticulously controlled; they are told when to eat and have no way of escaping due to their clothing allowing them to be directly controlled. During one of his scheduled mealtimes, 063y hears a familiar alarm—one signifying the arrival of the Flowers. Rushed into battle with his wife and fellow soldiers, they face off against an especially powerful enemy. With everyone defeated except for the pair, they move to flee when suddenly reinforcements arrive and turn the tide of the fight. While celebrating, 063y and F66x are dumbstruck as their allies suddenly turn and begin throwing themselves off a nearby cliff. Their commander appears, explaining that it was an order to jump, and the fact that the two didn't meant they were defective and were to be disposed of. F66x is stabbed, and before her husband can meet the same fate, she shoves him off the cliff where he survives by landing on the broken bodies of his comrades. Some time later, F66x awakens in a ruin, her last memory being that of being stabbed and pushing 063y. She wanders for a while before coming across fellow soldiers, including her husband, and the couple return to a hideout where fellow escaped prisoners plot a large-scale rescue attempt. Putting this plan into motion, they eventually sneak back into the government facility with the goal of winning over their old allies. While searching for escape routes, 063y and F66x are confronted again by their former commander. He explains to them that humanity is actually extinct, and that the prisoners are all clones implanted with false memories that motivate them to fight. F66x is forced by her programming to attempt to kill her husband, but she resists until the end—the end of both the experiment, and her life.",
